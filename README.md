# Architecture Overview

Using AWS and HCP Credentials, you can create this architecture from a single `terraform apply` command (approx 35 mins build time).

# Build Environment

Executing this terraform definition will recreate the environment from the "Secure Service Networking for AWS" Instruqt workshop:
https://play.instruqt.com/hashicorp/tracks/secure-service-networking-for-aws


To run this you will need to set the following environment variables:

```sh
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
HCP_CLIENT_ID
HCP_CLIENT_SECRET
```

For example:
```sh
export HCP_CLIENT_ID=XxXx1xx47X5x4xxXxxXXXx0Xxx8xxxXX
export HCP_CLIENT_SECRET=Xxxx16xX2XXxXXxXxxx2xxxXxXXXxxxxXX0XxxXx_Xx4x09XxxXxxxxxxxxxxx9X
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXX6XXXXXX
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=Xx7XX9XxXXXXxxxXXx/xXXXXxx7xXXXxXXXxXXxX
```

Then:
```sh
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Approximately 25 - 30 minutes later you will receive the three HashiCups URLs for the three environments: EKS prod, EKS Dev, and ECS Dev.

To access the HCP Consul UI, first fetch the ACL token so that you can login using the following command:

`terraform output hcp_acl_token_secret_id`
